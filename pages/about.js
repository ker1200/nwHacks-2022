        <p>
          DB Forum was created as a way for University students to create forum
          posts and ask questions with one another. This is the second program
          created by Drift Bapo, our first being DB Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was created on January 15, 2022 as part of the nwHacks 2022
          Hackathon.
