Feeling down during pandemic times? Stuck in quarantine with no one to talk to? Online class got you feeling the blues?

We created DB Forum so that students can share and converse with their peers, regardless of where they are. Forum posters can choose the name that shows up, so you can feel perfectly at ease sharing things anonymously or as yourself!

This web app was designed to be run with the [back-end API](https://github.com/elbfn103/dbforum-api) running in parallel.
